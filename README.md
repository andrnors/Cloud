The repository is an application written by Eirik Baug and Andreas Norstein for a school project at Queensland University of Technology in 2016.

The application is written in Node.js and attempts to stream all tweets that are being written by Twitter users about Hillary and Trump (the application was written just before the 2016 election).
Using sentiment analysis and text classification with the use of Bayes' Theorem the application attempts to analyse and display statistics about the approval of the presidential candidates based of the sentiment of the tweets the candidates name appears in.

The application streamed tweets for several days and concluded with a larger approval rating for Donal Trump.
